# unORIGINAL Piranha i3

The unORIGINAL Piranha i3 is a fork of the Original Prusa i3 MK3S by PRUSA RESEARCH.
Intended to bring the project back to its roots in the RepRap project, to be easy to replicate using only common tools and another 3D printer.

---

Design Goals:
- Reduce not only the quantity of vitamins (non-printed parts), but also the variety of them
	- Replace all instances of M3 Hex nuts with M3 Square nuts (the original design used both, but picking just one simplifies part sourcing)
- Port **all** parts to OpenSCAD
- Thorough documentation
	- BOM (s)
	- Build guide(s)
